# MAR

This is a project submitted for consideration under the Minimum Activity Requirement criteria of MAKAUT.

The project is developed in Python using matplotlib for visualization. It generates a grid of size N x N and fills it with rectangular obstacles. It then finds the shortest path between any two free points in the grid using the A* algorithm. The goal index is marked with a red '+'.
